As part of my internship at Codsoft, I undertook the project of creating a comprehensive and visually appealing personal portfolio website. 
This project aimed to showcase my skills, experience, and achievements in a professional manner while providing a platform to demonstrate 
my proficiency in web development and design. The portfolio includes sections on my background, projects, technical skills, and contact 
information, all crafted to highlight my capabilities and make a strong impression on potential employers and collaborators. This hands-on
experience has not only refined my technical abilitiesbut also enhanced my understanding of user-centric design and digitalÂ presentation.
